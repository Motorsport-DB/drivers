# Motorsport-DB - Drivers Directory

## Contribution Guidelines

Welcome to the **Drivers** repository of Motorsport-DB! This repository is dedicated to storing information about racing drivers in a structured format. We encourage contributions from the community to help build a comprehensive database.

### ‚úÖ **General Rules**
- All **images** used for drivers must be **free of copyright** or your own property.
- All **JSON files** must be **valid** and follow the correct format.
- The information provided **must be as accurate as possible**, including race results, birthdates, and other relevant details.
- Contributions **do not need to be complete**; even partial information is valuable!
- Any missing or incorrect information should be updated through pull requests (PRs).

### üõ† **How to Contribute**
1. **Fork the repository** to your account.
2. **Clone the forked repository** to your local machine.
3. **Create a new branch** with a descriptive name.
4. **Add or update JSON files** in the `drivers/` directory.
5. **Commit your changes** (see commit rules below).
6. **Push your branch** and open a pull request (PR) against the `main` branch.
7. **Wait for review and approval** before merging.

### üìú **JSON Formatting Guidelines**
Each driver should have a JSON file named `firstname_lastname.json` (e.g., `doriane_pin.json`).
